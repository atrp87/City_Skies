## General Information
- This allowed me to consolidate core concepts and refresh working with hooks ( more time spent on class components ) before looking into state management ( Redux ).
- This was also my fist real experience with Scss, I have a lot of appreciation for CSS as it seems like this never ending language where there is always something knew to learn.
- Scss is a great addition as itâ€™s very intuitive with nesting, variables and partials, I will definitely be using it in the future.

## Technologies Used

## Lessons Learned
- Passing, deconstructing and drilling props
